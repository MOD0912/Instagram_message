If you want to use Firofox you need geckodriver. If you want to use Chrome you need Chromedriver.
Chromedriver: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=94.0.4606.41/.
Geckodriver:  https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases.

How to add the driver to "PATH": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb9e3m98avk.
If you use chrome, you need to replace every "Firefox" with "chrome"(in vsc press ctrl+h).
If your laptop or computer is to slow, add more seconds in time.sleep.
If something doesn't work, try restarting the code. If it still doesn't work try restarting your Editor/IDE.
If it still doesn't work after restarting your Editor write me.
In case you use a specific time, make sure the program is always running and if you use "am" and "pm" you need to google how to change that.
